# review.nvim

Code review annotations for codediff.nvim, optimized for AI feedback loops.

Inspired by [tuicr](https://github.com/agavra/tuicr).

## Features

- Add comments to specific lines in diff view (Note, Suggestion, Issue, Praise)
- Comments displayed as signs, line highlights, and virtual text
- Comments persist per branch (stored in `~/.local/share/nvim/review/`)
- Auto-export comments to clipboard when closing
- Export format optimized for AI conversations
- Send comments directly to [sidekick.nvim](https://github.com/folke/sidekick.nvim) for AI chat
- Built on top of codediff.nvim

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.9
- [codediff.nvim](https://github.com/esmuellert/codediff.nvim)

## Configuration

```lua
require("review").setup({
  comment_types = {
    note = { key = "n", name = "Note", icon = "📝", hl = "ReviewNote" },
    suggestion = { key = "s", name = "Suggestion", icon = "💡", hl = "ReviewSuggestion" },
    issue = { key = "i", name = "Issue", icon = "⚠️", hl = "ReviewIssue" },
    praise = { key = "p", name = "Praise", icon = "✨", hl = "ReviewPraise" },
  },
  keymaps = {
    add_note = "<leader>cn",
    add_suggestion = "<leader>cs",
    add_issue = "<leader>ci",
    add_praise = "<leader>cp",
    delete_comment = "<leader>cd",
    edit_comment = "<leader>ce",
    next_comment = "]n",
    prev_comment = "[n",
  },
  export = {
    context_lines = 3,
    include_file_stats = true,
  },
  codediff = {
    readonly = true,
  },
})
```

## Export Format

Comments are exported as Markdown optimized for AI consumption:

```markdown
I reviewed your code and have the following comments. Please address them.

Comment types: ISSUE (problems to fix), SUGGESTION (improvements), NOTE (observations), PRAISE (positive feedback)

1. **[ISSUE]** `src/components/Button.tsx:23` - Wrapping onClick creates a new function every render
2. **[SUGGESTION]** `src/utils/api.ts:45` - Consider using useMemo here
3. **[PRAISE]** `src/hooks/useAuth.ts:12` - Clean implementation of the auth flow
```
